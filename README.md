# CVE ID
CVE-2024-30736

# Title
Insecure Deserialization Vulnerability in ROS Kinetic Kame

# Vulnerability Type
Insecure Deserialization

# Severity
TBD

# Vendor
The Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)

# Products Affected
ROS Kinetic Kame (ROS_VERSION=1 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3)

# Description
An insecure deserialization vulnerability has been identified in ROS Kinetic Kame. This vulnerability affects the data handling components, specifically those responsible for deserializing data. This vulnerability is particularly present in Data Serialization and Deserialization Components, Inter-Process Communication Mechanisms, and Network Communication Interfaces. These components can be manipulated if they process data from untrusted sources without adequate validation or sanitization, leading to arbitrary code execution. 

# Impact
Code Execution: True; 
Information Disclosure: True; 
Other: System and Network Compromise, Operational Disruption, Loss of Trust, and Reputation Damage.

# Attack Vector
The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious data, exploiting insecure network communication, compromised data sources, and through social engineering tactics.

# Solution
To remediate this vulnerability, users should immediately update to a secure version of ROS Kinetic Kame that addresses this issue. Additionally, it's critical to ensure all data deserialization processes are secure and validate data from external sources rigorously.

# Workaround
In the absence of a fix, users should implement stringent input validation and sanitization measures for data deserialization and enhance the overall security of their network communication to prevent exploitation.

# CVE Status
Confirmed and published.
